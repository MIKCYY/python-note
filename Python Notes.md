# Data Structures
- are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. 
- are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. 
- Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.
  # Built-in Data Structures
    > # Lists
    >> - are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
    >> - are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data.
    >> - Python lists are very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
    >> - List items are _ordered, changeable,_ and _allow duplicate values_.
    >> - are created using square brackets; it's also possible to use the `list()` constructor.
    >> - are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.
    >> - The `len()` function is used to determine the number of items a list has.
    >> - In Python, lists are defined as objects with the data type _'list'_. The `type()` function determines the data type of a list.
    >> ## Example:
    >> ``` py
    >>    thislist = ["apple", 5, True, 2.5, 5]       # OR thislist = list(("apple", 5, True, 2.5, 5))
    >>    print(thislist)                             # prints ["apple", 5, True, 2.5, 5]
    >>    print(len(thislist))                        # prints 5
    >>    print(type(mylist))                         # prints <class 'list'>
    >> ```
    >> ## Accessing Items
    >>> - By referring to the index number: `print(list[3])     #Prints the 4th item`
    >>> - By negative indexing: `print(list[-1])    #Prints the last item, and the 2nd last item if [-2]`
    >>> - By defining the start _(included)_ and end _(not included)_Â of a range, we can specify a range of indexes: <br/>                                `print(list[2:5]) #Prints the 3rd, 4th & 5th item`
    >>> - By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item: <br/>                                                                       `print(list[:5] #Prints the items from the start to, but NOT including, the 5th item)`
    >>> - By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list: <br/>                                                                  `print(list[2:] #Prints from the 3rd item to, including, the end)`
    >>> - By specifying negative indexes if we want to start the search from the end of the list: <br/>                                               `print(list[-4:-1]) #Prints the items from index -4 (included) to index -1 (last item, excluded)`
    >>> ### Example
    >>> ``` py
    >>>    thislist = ["apple", 5, True, 2.5, 5]
    >>>    print(thislist[2])                        # prints True
    >>>    print(thislist[-2])                       # prints 2.5
    >>>    print(thislist[1:4])                      # prints [5, True, 2.5]
    >>>    print(thislist[:3])                       # prints ["apple", 5, True]
    >>>    print(thislist[1:])                       # prints [5, True, 2.5, 5]
    >>>    print(thislist[-4:-1])                    # prints [5, True, 2.5]
    >>> ```


# Variables
  > - Python has no command for declaring a variable. It is created when the first value is assigned.
  > - Multiple values can be assigned to multiple variables in one line. `Eg., x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"`
  > - Same value can be assignd to multiple variables. `Eg., x = y = z = "Orange"`
  > - The Python `print()` function is often used to output variables.
  > - Variables that are created outside of a function are known as **Global Variables**.
  > - A variable can have a short name `like x and y` or a more descriptive name `age, carname, total_volume`. 
  >   - **Rules for Python Variables:**
  >     - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
  >     - A variable name cannot start with a number. 
  >     - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores `(A-z, 0-9, and _ )`.
  >     - Variable names are case-sensitive. `Eg.,a = 4 A = "Hanna" # A will not overwrite a`
  > ### Example:
  > ``` py
  >    # Legal variable names with different techniques & values
  >      myVar = 5          # camel case with int data type
  >      MyVar = "Hanna"    # pascal case with str data type
  >      my_var = 'Ruth'    # snake case with str data type
  >      _x = 5.7           # float
  >      x2 = "Tsige"
  >    # Illegal variable names
  >      2x = "Hanna"
  >      x- = 'Ruth'
  >      x 2 = "Tsige"
  >```
 > ## Unpack a Collection
  >> - If there is a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows to extract the values into variables. This is called **_Unpacking_**.
  >> ### Example:
   >>``` py
   >>   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   >>   x, y, z = fruits
   >>   print(x)    # apple
   >>   print(y)    # banana
   >>   print(z)    # cherry
   >>```
 > ## Casting
  >> - It's used to specify the data type of a variable. 
  >> ### Example:
   >>``` py
   >>   x = str(3)      # x will be '3'
   >>   y = int(3)      # y will be 3
   >>   z = float(3)    # z will be 3.0
   >>```
 > ## **type()** Function
  >> - It's used to get the data type of a variable.
  >> ### Example:
   >>``` py
   >>   x = 5
   >>   y = "Hanna"
   >>   print(type(x))   # Prints <class 'int'>
   >>   print(type(y))   # Prints <class 'str'>
   >>```
 > ## Output Variables
   >> ### Example 1:
   >>``` py
   >>   x = "Python is awesome"
   >>   print(x)                  # Prints Python is awesome
   >>```
   >> ### Example 2:
   >>``` py
   >>   # Multiple variables separated by a comma:
   >>   x = "Python"
   >>   y = "is"
   >>   z = "awesome"
   >>   print(x, y, z)      # Prints Python is awesome
   >>```
   >> 
   >> - In the `print()` function, combining a string and a number with the `+` operator, Python will give you an _error_:
   >> - The best way to output multiple variables in the `print()` function is to separate them with _commas_, which even support different data types:
 > ## Global Variables
  >> - They can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside. 
  >> ### Example :
  >> - Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function
  >> ``` py
  >>    x = "awesome"
  >>    def myfunc():
  >>      print("Python is " + x)       # Prints Python is awesome
  >>    myfunc()
  >> ```
  >>
  >> ### **global** Keyword
  >> - Normally, when a variable is created inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.
  >> - It's used to create a global variable inside a function.
  >> #### Example 1:
  >> - If the `global` keyword is used, the variable belongs to the global scope:
  >> ``` py
  >>    def myfunc():
  >>      global x
  >>      x = "fantastic"
  >>    myfunc()
  >>    print("Python is " + x)   # Prints Python is fantastic.
  >> ``` 
  >>  #### Example 2:
  >> - Also, use the `global` keyword to refer to the variable when changing the value of a global variable inside a function:
  >> ``` py
  >>    x = "awesome"
  >>    def myfunc():
  >>      global x
  >>      x = "fantastic"
  >>    myfunc()
  >>    print("Python is " + x)   # Prints Python is fantastic.
  >> ```     
# Data Types
  > - It is an important concept.
  > - Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
  > - How to get the data type is found in the **type() function** example.
  > - Setting the data type is found in the very first example.
  > ## Built-in Data Types:
   >> ``` py
   >>    Text Type:	str
   >>    Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
   >>    Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
   >>    Mapping Type:	dict
   >>    Set Types:	set, frozenset
   >>    Boolean Type:	bool
   >>    Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
   >>    None Type:	NoneType
   >> ```
  > ## Setting the Specific Data Type
   >> ### Example 
   >>  ``` py
   >> x = str("Hanna")
   >> x = int(20)
   >> x = float(20.5)
   >> x = complex(1j)
   >> x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
   >> x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
   >> ```
